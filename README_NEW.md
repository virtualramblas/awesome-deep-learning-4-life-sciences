# awesome-deep-learning-4-life-sciences
This repo lists a collection of resources for performing Deep Learning in [Python](https://www.python.org) for Life Sciences. Since the end of 2021 I started observing an always growing volume of academic work and Open Source initiatives related to topics such as biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, etc. Being my study background in Biomedical Engineering and Deep Learning, coming from past experiences as Software Engineer and currently working on applying ML/DL to real-life use cases in the pharma industry, these new Open Source efforts have caught my interest. That's why finally I decided to start this repository to provide researchers, developers and practitioners a single place to keep track of the latest developments in this space, with focus in particular on biotech and pharma.  
Contributions, suggestions and stars are welcome!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tools, Frameworks & Libraries
* [nglview](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview) - A Jupyter widget to interactively view molecular structures and trajectories.  
* [Panel-Chemistry](https://github.com/marcskovmadsen/panel-chemistry) - Easy exploratory data analysis and build powerful data and viz tools within the domain of Chemistry using Python and HoloViz Panel.  
* [libmolgrid](https://github.com/gnina/libmolgrid) - A comprehensive library for fast, GPU accelerated molecular gridding for Deep Learning workflows. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04822.pdf)]  
* [stmol](https://github.com/napoles-uach/stmol) - A component for building interactive molecular 3D visualizations within Streamlit web applications.  
* [MolecularNodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes) - An add-on and set of pre-made nodes for Blender & Blenderâ€™s Geometry Nodes, to import, animate and manipulate molecular data.  
* [Jupyter Dock](https://github.com/AngelRuizMoreno/Jupyter_Dock) - Molecular Docking integrated in Jupyter notebooks.  
* [AugLiChem](https://github.com/BaratiLab/AugLiChem) - A data augmentation library for chemical structures. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15112)]  
* [Chemiscope](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/chemiscope) - An interactive structure/property explorer for materials and molecules. While the core project is implemented in a different programming language, it has been added to this list because it provides Python extensions that allow using it within a Jupyter or Colab notebook.
